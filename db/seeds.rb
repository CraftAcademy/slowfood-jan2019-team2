# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  product = Product.create(name: 'Pizza', price: 100, description: 'Lord of the Rings')
